Alone
Marshmello

I'm so alone
Nothing feels like home
I'm so alone
Trying to find
My way back home to you

I'm so alone
Nothing feels like home
I'm so alone
Trying to find
My way back home to you

I'm so alone
Trying to find
My way back home to you

I'm so alone
Nothing feels like home
I'm so alone
Trying to find
My way back home to you

I'm so alone
Nothing feels like home
I'm so alone
Trying to find
My way back home to you

I'm so alone
Trying to find
My way back home to you
